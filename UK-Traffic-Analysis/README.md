- ### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

  - Identified and calculated primary KPIs, including Total Casualties and Total Accidents, for 2021 and 2022. YoY growth percentages were computed to assess trends and improvements.

- ### Accident Severity Analysis:

  - Analyzed accident severity by categorizing casualties into severity levels (Fatal, Serious, Minor) for both years. YoY growth percentages for each severity level were calculated.

- ### Vehicle Type Analysis:

  - Analyzed casualties based on vehicle types (Car, Truck, Motorcycle) for 2021 and 2022. YoY growth percentages were considered to identify trends.

- ### Geospatial Analysis:

  - Conducted geospatial analysis to determine casualties and accidents by road type, location, and time of day for the UK in 2021 and 2022.

- ### Monthly Trends Comparison:

  - Created a monthly trend analysis for a year-over-year comparison of casualties in 2021 and 2022.

## Key Insights

| Insights   | Descriptions                                        |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Stakeholder Understanding**  | Understanding the stakeholders and users of a dashboard is crucial for developing and designing an effective dashboard. |
| **Time Intelligence in Power BI**  |  Creating a date table is crucial for time intelligence functions in Power BI, ensuring accurate year-to-date calculations and other time-related analyses. |
| **Custom DAX Functions in Power BI**  |  Utilizing custom DAX functions in Power BI allows for more flexibility and control in calculating and displaying key performance indicators. |
| **Positive Trend in Road Accidents**  | Fatal casualties have decreased by **33%**, showing a positive trend in road accidents. |
| **Tableau Performance Advantage**  | Tableau's ability to store data in compressed size and fire queries to high-profile data results in faster loading time and increased performance, making it a valuable tool for data analysis. |
| **Insightful Visualization with Sparklines**  |  The visualization of monthly accident trends using sparklines provides valuable insights into the patterns and changes over time. |
| **Importance of Data Cleaning**  |  Data cleaning is essential to ensure accuracy and consistency in the dataset, including checking for typos and missing values. |
| **Discrepancies in Results Across Platforms**  |  The SQL queries are used to find the current year casualties, and the results differ between Power BI, Tableau, and Excel dashboards due to the different filters and data sources used. |
